# Virus-Total-Python-Tools

A small collection of python scripts that i've written that uses the VirusTotal API to assist in Web Security.

Auto URL Scanner: Python script that takes in a list of URL's from a user and an API key, the script runs those URL's through the VT API and outputs the response to a .TXT file with how suspicious they were determined to be. The script runs on a 15 second delay between each request, though this can be changed if you have a premium API key.
